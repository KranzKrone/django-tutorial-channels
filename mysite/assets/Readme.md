# Assets 

Here we store JavaScript, CSS, PNG, ico, and other static files used within our application packages. These files are transferred from the static file directories of the packages used by the application with the following command:

     $ python manage.py collectstatic

For that reason, place all static files required by your package here, e.g., jQuery, Fonts, etc.
